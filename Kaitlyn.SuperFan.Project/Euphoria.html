						<p> Rue struggles with her addiction to drugs. Her past has a role in this. She has suffered from panic attacks since
						she was 11 and was even given liquid Valium to calm her down. This along with the death of her father is what
						drove to start taking heavy drugs. And even though she recently ODâ€™d, and her sister found her nearly lifeless 
						body on the floor, she still pursues that high which takes her away from the pain. </p>

						<p> Jules comes into town the summer Rue overdosed. Rue quickly catches feelings for her when seeing how
						wild and brave Jules is. The friendship and her crush on Jules motivates her to quit drugs. Though this helps
						her and her relationship with her family, jules becomes a subsitute for the drugs in Rue's life
						which becomes toxic when the realization that Jules doesn't exactly feel the same way for her becomes apparent.</p>
