							<p> Rue struggles with her addiction to drugs. Her past has a role in this. She has suffered from panic attacks since
						she was 11 and was even given liquid Valium to calm her down. This along with the death of her father is what
						drove to start taking heavy drugs. And even though she recently OD’d, and her sister found her nearly lifeless 
						body on the floor, she still pursues that high which takes her away from the pain. </p>

						which becomes toxic when the realization that Jules doesn't exactly feel the same way for her becomes apparent.</p>

							<p>So far the show has hinted that the majority of Nate’s rage stems from him being aware of his father’s repressed sexuality after watching his dad’s ultra-organized videos(sexual)
							collection and not being able to talk about it. And from his fixation on his own “perfection”
							— modeled after his father’s pursuit of perfection and disdain for “weakness” — we know Cal having that big secret about his 
							sexuality is technically an imperfection to his obsessive son. That Cal trying to hold on to his hollow and frankly sad 
							definition of masculinity is inspiring a horrendously toxic version of that in Nate.</p>
